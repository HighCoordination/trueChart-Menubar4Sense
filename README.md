**Dynamic font sizing**
The option to set the font size dynamically allows for responsive font sizing depending on the width of the extension object.

**Hide elements in Sense mobile view**
Now you can hide MENUBAR elements when Qlik Sense is in mobile mode. Just activate the checkbox in the property panel and the element is not active in Sense mobile mode. Inactive elements dont trigger any actions or behaviors such as the default selections.

**Individual colors for all elements**
Individual colors can be defined for every element of the MENUBAR. There is no limitation on what you want to style. Even the funkiest MENUBAR can now be designed.

The option to style the sheet background allows you to style the Sense sheet background with an
image, color or both. This also works in storymode if a menubar elements is placed on the slide and has an active background styling.
