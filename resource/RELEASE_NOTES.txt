                       he must also specify the sorting by selection status. With this sort, the selection behavior
                       corresponds to the Qlik Sense standard.
                     * The recommendation is to define sorting by selection status for Sense Selects and
                       never for single selection (corresponds to the automatic behavior).
    * [HICO-2357] - Performance improvement: Single Selects default selections are triggered multiple times
